# FeelSenseAI - Customer Emotion Analysis

## Project Overview
FeelSenseAI is a machine learning project designed to analyze customer emotions based on text input. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify emotions and provide insights that businesses can use to better understand customer sentiments.

## Features
- Text Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Label Encoding for Emotion Categories
- Model Building Using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)
- Training and Validation
- Prediction and Evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of customer texts labeled with different emotions such as:
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Fearful
- Surprise
- Neutral

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dharshini2284/FeelSenseAI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    cd FeelSenseAI
    jupyter notebook Customer_Emotion_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
3. Install the necessary packages if not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run all the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Project Structure
- `Customer_Emotion_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt` (to be added): List of required libraries.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time chat systems.
- Visualization dashboard for emotion trends.
- Experiment with more advanced NLP models like BERT.
