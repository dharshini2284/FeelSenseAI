# FeelSenseAI - Customer Emotion Analysis

## Project Overview
FeelSenseAI is a machine learning project designed to analyze customer emotions based on text input. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify emotions and provide insights that businesses can use to better understand customer sentiments.

- Surprise
- Neutral

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dharshini2284/FeelSenseAI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    cd FeelSenseAI
    jupyter notebook Customer_Emotion_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
3. Install the necessary packages if not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run all the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Project Structure
